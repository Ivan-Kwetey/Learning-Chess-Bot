# Learning-Chess-Bot
A learning Chess bot project

The primary goal of this learning chess bot is to win matches against random bots by making effective and efficient decisions within a limited time frame. Using time-limited analysis, the bot dynamically allocates computational resources based on the remaining time, maximizing its chances of making optimal moves. This approach enables the bot to adapt to varying opponent strengths, employ resource-efficient strategies, and gain a competitive advantage by quickly exploiting opponents' weaknesses.

Human players, who learn by challenging Stockfish, develop their unique playing styles due to differences in intuition, creativity, and experiential learning compared to Stockfish's computational analysis. This project aims to create a bot that blends the strategic depth of machine learning with the adaptability and creativity of human play.
